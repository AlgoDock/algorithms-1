/* https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/#/description
Given a string s and a non-empty string p, find all the start indices of p's anagrams in s.

Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings s and p will not be larger than 20,100.

The order of output does not matter.

Example 1:
    Input:
    s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"
    Output:
    [0, 6]

Explanation:
    The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
    The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".

Example 2:
    Input:
    s: "abab" p: "ab"
    Output:
    [0, 1, 2]

Explanation:
    The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
    The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
    The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
