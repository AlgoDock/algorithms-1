/* https://leetcode.com/problems/judge-route-circle/description/
Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to the original place.

The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid robot moves are R (Right), L (Left), U (Up) and D (down).
The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.

Example 1:
    Input: "UD"
    Output: true

Example 2:
    Input: "LL"
    Output: false
