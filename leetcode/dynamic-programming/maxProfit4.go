/* https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv/#/description
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k transactions.

Note:
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
